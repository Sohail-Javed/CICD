# Define the triggers for the pipeline
on:
  push:  # Trigger the pipeline on push to specific branches
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
  pull_request:  # Trigger the pipeline on pull request events
    branches:
      - main
  schedule:  # Optionally trigger the pipeline on a schedule (e.g., daily at midnight)
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

# Define the jobs that should be run as part of the pipeline

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use a Linux virtual environment
